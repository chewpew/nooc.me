# Why Another Blog?

Yes, I have integrated another blog system into my personal website. Before this, I already had a personal blog called "[Subjective World](https://subnooc.com)" where I occasionally vent my thoughts. However, I always intended for that blog to only share my personal insights, thoughts, and book notes - essentially, non-technical content. Right from the start, I had no plans to publish any technical-related content on that blog, and I even decided not to include any images, keeping it purely text-based.

But sometimes, I still had the desire to share some of my technical experiments and records. I tried using GitHub's [Discussions](https://github.com/noobnooc/noobnooc/discussions), and to be honest, it was sufficient. It had all the necessary features. However, my inclination to tinker couldn't be suppressed, and I couldn't help but find the limitations of that approach, such as the lack of customization, difficulty in discovery due to deep navigation, and the inability to drive traffic to my own website.
