Yes, after publishing just one post on this blog, I've already changed the domain. From subjective.world to subnooc.com.

Since barely anyone knows about this blog, I originally planned to quietly start using the new domain and pretend the old one never existed. But someone caught on and asked why I switched. The question sent me into deep reflection — why did I change it? Maybe I don't even know.

Like changing screen names when I was younger, perhaps swapping my online identity from time to time brings a fresh feeling. Even though from others' perspective nothing much has changed, I just can't help myself.

I do understand that things like screen names and domains don't carry much meaning in themselves — they're just labels identifying the entity behind them. What I've written and will write on this site is what shapes people's impression of the name and domain, not the other way around.

Maybe the label has some tiny influence, but the bigger picture is how you use content to shape that identity.

That said, let me explain why I switched to this particular domain.

First, as an unemployed wanderer, price is obviously the primary factor. A .world domain costs $23 per year, while .com is only $9.

Second, .world is just too obscure. So obscure that writing "subjective.world" by itself doesn't even register as a domain name to most people — you'd basically need to spell out the full URL https://subjective.world for anyone to recognize it as a web address. In this regard, .com is much better — just writing subnooc.com is enough for people to know it's a website.

Finally, subjective.world felt more like a brand or column rather than a personal blog — too serious for my taste. subnooc.com incorporates my online handle "nooc." The "sub" prefix can be read as "a part of Nooc," or as an abbreviation for "Subjective Nooc" — meaning "Nooc's Subjective World."

So that's the story. The subjective.world domain currently redirects to subnooc.com. As for whether I'll renew it and what I'd use it for — that's a question for another day. Who knows, maybe I'll get the itch to switch back.
